In this section, you will learn about how to use Nervos CKB in practice. This includes [running a CKB node](run-node), [interacting with it](interact), as well as [mining](mine) and [transferring](transfer) CK Bytes.
<!-- Todo: change the version here -->

Please note that this document is compatible with the `ckb 0.13.0 (rylai-v2 v0.13.0 2019-06-01)`. More information about CKB versions can be found in [the CKB repo on GitHub](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb).

## System Requirements
Any modern computer should be able to run CKB node and mining programs.

As for operating system, only **macOS** and **Linux** are supported at the moment. Other operating systems can [use docker](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/docs/run-ckb-with-docker.md) for now. The native supports will be developed in the future.

## Testnet


Before you start to have some fun with the testnet, here are something you should notice:
* The CKB testnet is only for development and test use.
* The tokens on this testnet has nearly no values, so please be aware of scams.
* **The testnet will be reset and updated every two weeks**, so any tokens or states you have on the testnet will be cleared upon the testnet reset.

## Prerequisites
As most of the guidances in this document are based on command line interface, you might need to know [how to use the command line tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+command+line) on your computer.
