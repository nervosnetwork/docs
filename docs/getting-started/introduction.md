In this section, you will learn about how to use Nervos CKB in practice. This includes [running a CKB node](run-node) and [mining](mine) CK Bytes.
<!-- Todo: change the version here -->

Please note that this document is compatible with the `ckb 0.23.0 (rylai-v11 52aa02ff 2019-10-19)`. More information about CKB versions can be found in [the CKB repo on GitHub](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb).

## System Requirements
Any modern computer should be able to run CKB node and mining programs.

Recommended Operating System:  
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS x86-64
* macOS

Experimentally Supported Systemï¼š  
* Windows x86-64
 
Theoretically Supported System:
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x86-64
* Arch Linux x86-64
* Centos 7 x86-64
* Debian x86-64, Stretch or later


You can also [use docker](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/docs/run-ckb-with-docker.md) if your operating system is not properly supported by CKB for now.

## Testnet


Before you start to have some fun with the testnet, here are something you should notice:
* The CKB testnet is only for development and test use.
* The tokens on this testnet has nearly no values, so please be aware of scams.
* **The testnet will be reset and updated every two weeks**, so any tokens or states you have on the testnet will be cleared upon the testnet reset.

## Prerequisites
As most of the guidances in this document are based on command line interface, you might need to know [how to use the command line tool](https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+command+line) on your computer.
