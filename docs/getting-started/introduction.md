<!-- Todo: change the version here -->

Please note that this document is compatible with the `ckb 0.12.0 (v0.12.0 2019-05-17)`. More information about CKB versions can be found in [the CKB repo on GitHub](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb).

## Testnet


Before you start to have some fun with the testnet, here are something you should notice:
* The CKB testnet is only for development and test use.
* The tokens on this testnet has nearly no values, so please be aware of scams.
* **The testnet will be reset and updated every two weeks**, so any tokens or states you have on the testnet will be cleared upon the testnet reset.

## Prerequisites
