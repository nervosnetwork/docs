**Q: Why does the balance not match with that on CKB Explorer?**

A: Please wait until Neuron fully synced with CKB network. The bottom left indicator shows the sync progress.

**Q: Why does the Neuron show "sync failed, please check the network", but my network is ok.**

A: If you are running an early version Windows operating system, you need to install [VC++ redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) to fix the problem.
