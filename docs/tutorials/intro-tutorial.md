---

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial will teach you how to start building dApps with Nervos CKB. With the available SDK that is provided below, we will walk you through the major functions of the SDK and how to start transferring Nervos native tokens from one wallet to another.

Before starting this tutorial, it is helpful to understand the key concepts of __Nervos CKB__ as outlined in the [Basic Concepts](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-ruby) in order to have the sufficient background required to complete this tutorial.

## Native tokens on CKB
The native token for Nervos CKB is CKBytes. 1 CKByte represents 1 byte of storage on the Nervos network.

## What you will be building
In this tutorial, you will be building a way to send and receive Nervos native tokens from multiple wallets. In order to do this, we will walk you through:

## Creating a Wallet
* [Step 1 - How to get started and install SDK](../tutorials/step1)  -  ~ 30 minutes
* [Step 2 - How to create a wallet](../tutorials/step2) -  ~ 45 - 100 minutes

## Mining Tokens
* [Step 3 - Mining native tokens](../tutorials/step3)  -  ~ 60 minutes

## Building a Transaction
* [Step 4 - Constructing a Cell](../tutorials/step4) ~ 15 minutes
* [Step 5 - Constructing a Transaction](../tutorials/step5) ~ 15 minutes
* [Step 6 - Transaction Signing](../tutorials/step6) ~ 15 minutes
* [Step 7 - Scripts](../tutorials/step7) ~ 15 minutes
* [Step 8 - Creating Lock Script](../tutorials/step8) ~ 15 minutes

## Transferring Tokens

* [Step 9 - Sending a transaction to the network](../tutorials/step9) ~ 15 minutes
* [Step 10 - Retrieving information about a transaction](../tutorials/step10) ~ 15 minutes
* [Step 11 - Receiving native tokens and retrieving your balance](../tutorials/step11)  ~ 15 minutes

## Prerequisite(s)
* Knowledge of Ruby development
* Knowledge of Cell Model,Cell Capacity, Transaction Creation, Type & Lock Scripts
* Knowledge of Digital Signatures: Signing and Verification
* Knowledge of State Generation and Verification in CKB
* Knowledge of Public/Private Key Cryptography
* Familiarity with Bitcoin UTXO Models and Ethereum Smart Contracts
