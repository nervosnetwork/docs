Welcome to the Nervos community.

This is the documentation site for Nervos. Here you can learn the knowledge of Nervos CKB, as well as how to develop applications on it.

Please note that this document is compatible with the `ckb 0.11.0-pre (rylai12 2019-05-05)`. More information about CKB versions can be found in [the CKB repo on GitHub](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb).

## Background Knowledge
The concepts outlined in this documentation are highly technical. It is required that you have some basic knowledge about blockchain technology in general before you start to learn from this document.

As Nervos CKB has a very similar structure to Bitcoin, I'd recommend you to read [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) to pick up some background knowledge.
